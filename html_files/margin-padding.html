<h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2>

<p class="wrap">The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
    (Learn more about the CSS box model <a href="https://learnlayout.com/"
    target="_blank" onclick="window.open(this.href)";>here</a>)
    It consists of: borders, padding, margins, and the actual content.</p>

<div>This text is the content of the box. I have added a 50px padding, 20px margin and 
    a 15px green border. The green border shows the border of the actual container.
    The distance between this paragraph and beige rectangle (50px) is the padding, i.e padding
    is the distance between the <span class="italicize">inside</span> border of
    a container and its container. The margin is the distance between the green
    border of and the black border of the above paragraph (15px), i.e margin is the 
    distance between the <span class="italicize">outside</span> border of
    the container and other containers.
