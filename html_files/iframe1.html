  <h2>This is a separate webpage!</h2>
  <p>Note that the information in this window is from another website! Iframes are a way of 
    displaying another webpage within your current webpage, such as having an embed youtube video
    . (Below is an example of an embded youtube video). However, not all websites
    can be displayed with Iframes, as some websites set  their site such that
    their website can only be called in iframes on their own domain.

    Note that all these items are aligned vertically! Use <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"
    target="_blank" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">flexbox</a> 
    to dynamically align items/ align items along axes.
